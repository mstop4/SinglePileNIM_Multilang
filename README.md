# Single Pile NIM Multilanguage

Single Pile NIM game written in multiple languages. It's like "Hello, World!", but more complicated.

**Rules**

The game starts with ***N*** objects. The human player and computer player each take turns taking 1 to ***M*** objects from ***N***. Whoever takes the last object loses. The human player always goes first.

***M*** is determined randomly each game (= an integer between 2 and 5 inclusive). ***N*** is calculated with random factors based on the value of ***M*** (possible range of ***N***: an integer between 7 to 35 inclusive).
